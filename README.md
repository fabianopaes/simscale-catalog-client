# simscale-catalog-client

You might have a Java 8 and Gradle properly installed in your own machine to build/run this project.

Other way to run is just to execute the follow commands:

chmod +x gradlew

./gradlew build

The second one will build and generate a jar file and then, just type ...

java -jar build/libs/simscale-catalog-client-1.0.0.jar
